# Digital Forensics Case Study

## 📌 Project Overview
This case study analyzes a forensic disk image and memory dump using Autopsy and Volatility to extract artifacts, build a timeline, and identify indicators of compromise.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Autopsy
- Volatility
- FTK Imager (optional)
- Sample images (CTF challenges)

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform triage on a forensic image
- Extract artifacts (browser history, deleted files)
- Analyze memory dump for processes & connections
- Build forensic timeline

## 📝 Deliverables
- Forensic report (PDF in /reports)
- Extracted IOCs (hashes, domains, processes)
- Blog article link: [Coming Soon]

## 🚀 How to Reproduce
1. Acquire forensic image from [CTF / DFIR.training]  
2. Analyze disk with Autopsy  
3. Use Volatility to extract memory artifacts  
4. Build timeline and report
